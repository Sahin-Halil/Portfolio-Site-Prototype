# Portfolio-Site-Prototype

# Introduction
Welcome to my portfolio website! This project showcases my skills, projects, and accomplishments. It’s built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I’m hosting it locally using XAMPP.

# Features
- Responsive Design: The website adapts to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- Project Showcase: This is only a prototype, so I haven't included any projects I have done.
- Contact Information: Visitors can find ways to get in touch with me.
- Smooth Animations: I’ve added subtle animations to enhance the user experience.

# Database Integration
1. User table:
    - The database stores user credentials and manages sessions.
      
2. Blog Posts and Comments:
    - For blog posts, I’ve created a posts table in the database.
    - Each post has fields like title, content, and timestamp.
    - Comments are stored in a separate comments table, linked to the relevant post.

3. Database Technology:
    - I’ve included the database file directly in this repository.
    - You can find the database files in the database folder

# Setup
1. Install XAMPP:
    - If you haven’t already, download and install XAMPP from the official website.
    - 
2. Start the Apache and MySQL services.
    - Clone or Download This Repository:
    - Clone this repository to your XAMPP htdocs directory (usually located at C:\xampp\htdocs).
    - Alternatively, download the ZIP file and extract it to the same location.
      
3. Access the Website:
    - Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost/your-folder-name.
    - Replace your-folder-name with the actual folder name where you placed the project files.
